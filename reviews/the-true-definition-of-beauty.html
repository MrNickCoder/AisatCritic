  Die Beautiful, a story with a lesson and inspiration for gay people or even
  for those living in the world. The summary of the story is about the life of a
  gay person and how he expressed himself in competitions and socialized with
  friends, as well as took care of his adopted child Sherlimae, even though this
  was not his biological child. Trisha Echavaria, the protagonist of this movie,
  was still a child when she fully embraced being gay, and her friends were
  deeply fascinated with competitions; they created their own contests just to
  enjoy themselves and pursue their desires as they grew up. However, even as a
  child, her father opposed what she was doing because he did not want her to be
  gay and opposed her actions. Even though he is not liked by his own father
  because of his desires or the things he does as a gay person, he is strong and
  resilient, my friend, and regarding his child, his child Sherlimae already
  knows that this is not her real parent, Trisha. She also knows that he is gay.
  Nevertheless, she loves him very much because he raised her and paved the way
  for a good life. She gets teased and mocked at school because her parent is
  gay. Whenever there is an event at her school about parents, Sherlimae doesn’t
  know what to do because she will just be teased again by her classmates. At
  the beginning of the story, it is shown here that it simply narrates the life
  of Trisha Echavaria and how her life turned out. We can watch and see that she
  has a friend who is always with her and her one and only companion in whatever
  they want to do.

  One time, she was with her father and her sister; the three of them sat
  together at a dining table, and this was where the argument between Trisha and
  her father started because of her being gay. The next day, Trisha Echavaria
  joined a competition, and when it ended, her father found out, which led to
  another argument and misunderstanding. Her father got angry, disapproving of
  what Trisha was doing, and said harsh things, declaring that he would no
  longer allow his surname to be used, which is why she now uses the name Trisha
  Echavaria. She was kicked out because her father no longer accepted her being
  gay. Nevertheless, she continued to be with her friends, and that’s where they
  stayed together, but it was also painful for Trisha because this was her
  family, yet there was nothing she could do since her father didn't want her.
  So she decided to rely on herself.

  In the middle of the movie, it can be seen here that the two friends,
  including Trisha, went to a bar, and it can be seen that there were men
  dancing. One of them became interested in Trisha, and eventually, Trisha also
  liked him. She ended up being with him, and they became a couple. Her
  daughter, Sherlimae, saw this and didn't like Trisha's boyfriend because of
  his behavior. The man even said that she could just call him 'daddy.' Also,
  Trisha was seen on television participating in contests or a Ms. Gay pageant.
  One time, her sister saw her on TV and was surprised and amazed at her sister
  Trisha's beauty. By chance, they also met at a restaurant, and Trisha's
  expression couldn't be painted because she was slightly upset with her sister
  due to her not defending her when there was an argument between their father
  and Trisha.
