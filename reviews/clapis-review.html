  Baby Ruth Villarama’s Sunday Beauty Queen is a heartfelt and eye opening
  documentary that follows the lives of Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong
  as they prepare for community-organized beauty pageants during their precious
  day off. While the film might initially appear to highlight glamour and
  pageantry, it ultimately reveals a deeper narrative—one anchored in sacrifice,
  resilience, and the struggle for dignity in a foreign land.

  The women featured in the documentary are not merely workers, they are
  mothers, daughters, and breadwinners carrying the weight of expectations from
  home. The beauty pageants they join become more than contests they serve as
  their escape, their therapy, and their way of reclaiming confidence in a world
  that often make them feel invisible. Villarama’s lens humanizes these OFWs,
  revealing their vulnerabilities and the emotional labor behind every smile
  they wear onstage.

  One of the most notable moments for me, it appears at 13:29 to 13:43, when
  Rudelie Acosta says, “What hurts the most, tomorrow is the first day of school
  and also my youngest’s birthday… I’ve nothing to give.” This line pierces
  through the film’s colorful surface and exposes one of the painful truths
  about the OFW experience. Migration does not automatically lead to financial
  security. Rudelie’s confession captures the painful contradiction many
  overseas workers endure. While Filipinos often regard OFWs as “modern-day
  heroes,” the everyday hardships they face are regularly overlooked, hidden
  behind expectations of constant success and stability.

  This moment challenges the common stereotype that OFWs are automatically
  “mayaman.” Society tends to assume that working abroad guarantees a
  comfortable life, but Rudelie’s words reveal how many OFWs still struggle
  paycheck to paycheck. They work long hours in physically demanding domestic
  jobs, often sacrificing their own needs just to send money home. The inability
  to provide even a small gift for a child’s birthday, despite being abroad,
  stress the emotional cost of migration one that includes guilt, homesickness,
  and the unspoken pressure to meet their family’s and society’s expectations.

  The documentary also portrays how many OFWs must choose between saving a
  little for themselves or sending everything back home, leaving them with
  almost nothing. Villarama positions these pageants as a symbolic act of
  reclaiming agency. Every time these women step onto the stage, they
  momentarily transform from workers to queens women who deserve joy,
  recognition, and pride. The pageants illustrate their resilience, creativity,
  and ability to find light despite the exhaustion and emotional burden that
  they carry.

  Sunday Beauty Queen strongly shows how unfair the expectations on OFWs can be.
  Through the honest stories shown in the film, it encourages viewers to see the
  real people and emotions behind every OFW’s hard work and sacrifices. The film
  reminds us that behind the image of a “hero” is a person silently hoping that
  all the pain and distance will one day be worth it.
