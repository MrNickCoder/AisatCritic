	<p class="p text-justify">Die Beautiful (2016), directed by Paolo Ballesteros, follows the life of Trisha, a transgender woman who dreams of living freely and finding happiness in her own identity. At first glance, the film appears lighthearted, filled with colorful makeup transformations, energetic pageant scenes, and comedic interactions that highlight Trisha’s charismatic personality. However, as the story progresses, the deeper emotional layers of her journey begin to surface. Behind the humor lies a narrative shaped by struggle, resilience, and the constant pursuit of acceptance. The film not only entertains but also invites viewers to reflect on identity, self-love, and the importance of being true to oneself—despite the challenges that come with it.</p>

	<p class="h4">Tracing Trisha’s Journey: Life, Death, and Identity</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">The heart of Die Beautiful is Trisha’s life story, told through non-linear flashbacks that begin immediately after her death. This structure allows the audience to revisit key memories that shaped her—moments of joy, pain, rejection, discovery, and self-expression. Trisha’s experiences reflect the reality faced by many transgender individuals: the struggle to be recognized, understood, and respected, even by their own families.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">Despite these hardships, Trisha continues to live with confidence and laughter. Her personality shines in every scene, but the film makes it clear that her bright smile often masks deep emotional wounds. Her journey becomes a powerful reminder that identity is not something granted by others—it is something a person must hold onto fiercely, even when the world tries to take it away.</p>

	<p class="h4">A Meaningful Scene: Beauty, Memory, and being Remembered True</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">One of the strongest moments in the film takes place during a quiet conversation between Trisha and her best friend, Barbs. Away from the spotlight of pageants and performances, Trisha reveals a deeply personal wish:</p>
	<p class="l text-center">“When I die, I want a different make-up look during my wake before you bury me. Promise me, okay?”</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">This line may seem simple on the surface, but the moment it is delivered transforms its meaning. Trisha is not only asking for makeup—she is asking to be remembered as the person she truly is. The scene reveals Trisha’s vulnerability and fear of being misrepresented, even in death. It also highlights her desire for dignity, identity, and love without conditions.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">For viewers, the line resonates as a message about authenticity. Trisha’s request symbolizes her fight for the right to exist unapologetically. It teaches that every person deserves recognition and remembrance that honors their real self—not the version others expect or prefer.</p>

	<p class="h4">Themes, Performances, and the Power of Chosen Family</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">Paolo Ballesteros brings Trisha to life with sincerity, emotional depth, and stunning nuance. His performance captures the duality of Trisha’s character—her loud confidence on stage and her quiet longing for acceptance when the lights go out. Each expression, gesture, and transformation reflects her identity and her desire to be seen beyond stereotypes.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">One of the film’s most beautiful aspects is the bond between Trisha and Barbs. Their friendship shows that love often comes not from blood relations but from people who choose to understand, protect, and cherish us. Through their relationship, the film highlights the concept of chosen family—a foundation of support especially significant in the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

	<p class="h4">Conclusion</p>

Trisha’s story reminds viewers that behind every face is a deeper story shaped by emotion, courage, and dreams. Her journey encourages audiences to look at others with compassion and understanding.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">The film leaves a powerful and lasting impression: that every person, regardless of gender identity, deserves love, respect, and the freedom to express their true self. Even long after the credits roll, Trisha’s story continues to inspire, challenge, and move those who watch it.</p>
