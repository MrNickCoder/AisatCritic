	<p class="p text-justify">Die Beautiful is one of those Filipino films that really hits you when you least expect it. It tells the story of Trisha, a transgender woman who only wants to live happily and be remembered in a beautiful way. Even with the hurtful things people throw at her, she keeps choosing laughter, makeup, and confidence, which is honestly inspiring. The perfect example is the scene where she did her makeup transformation even when she’s already struggling financially, because beauty and self expression is her form of strength.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">It's like going through an emotional roller coaster while watching the movie. There are just so many funny scenes that could get you laughing, especially the moments between Trisha and her best friend Barbs. For example, their playful moment during the beauty pageant when Barbs jokingly scolds Trisha for entering another contest again. But behind the smiles, the movie also shows the sufferings caused by the rejections and judgments of people.  It reminds us that sometimes the happiest people in front of us are the ones hurting the most inside. Like when Trisha got disowned by her own father after being caught wearing makeup, truly a moment that shows how deep the pain of rejection is.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">Since the movie itself showed many heartwarming messages, some of the most important were about family. Trisha's friends, especially Barbs, are her real support system while her biological family finds it difficult to accept her identity. They are the ones that stands by her side, celebrating with her during happy times and defending her during her painful times. Like how Barbs fought for Trisha’s body after she died, refusing Trisha’s father to take her and do a burial that is against all of Trisha's wishes.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">This movie teaches us that family is not just about blood, but it's about the love, the loyalty, and the understanding. That whoever truly cares for you in life is your real family. Like how Barbs is lovingly do Trisha’s makeup in her wake to fulfill her request.</p>

	<p class="p text-justify">It also reminds us to be true to ourselves because pretending will only make us feel more lost. It also shows that we should respect others for who they are. We don’t know the battles they’re hiding behind a smile. And most importantly, that real love doesn’t judge, it accepts you fully. Like when Barbs tells Trisha in one of the scenes</p>
	<p class="l text-center">“Kung sino ka, iyon ang mahal namin”</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">This simple line reflects the unconditional acceptance that she didn’t receive from her biological family.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">Paolo Ballesteros did such an amazing job as Trisha. He made her feel like someone we actually know, someone brave, someone funny, someone human. The film also gives a voice to the LGBTQ+ community in the Philippines, showing the hardships they still face.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">At the end of it all, Die Beautiful stays with you. It makes you think twice about how you treat people. It makes you appreciate those who stay by your side. And honestly, it reminds you that everyone deserves to feel beautiful, loved, and respected for who they are.</p>
