</p>
<p class="{{roboto}} indent-10 text-justify w-11/12 md:w-full mb-2">
  The film opens with Trisha’s funeral preparations, immediately establishing a
  mix of comedy and emotion. Trisha’s friends meticulously prepare her body,
  dressing her in glamorous outfits inspired by famous female celebrities. One
  of the most memorable scenes shows her transformation into Madonna, complete
  with a sparkling gown and signature style, during which one friend remarks,
  “She lives her truth in every outfit.” This moment highlights the performative
  and deeply personal nature of gender expression, reinforcing that identity is
  both emotional and outwardly visible.

  The film does not shy away from the harsh realities of transphobia. In a
  flashback, Trisha experiences harassment while walking through a public space,
  where a man mocks her appearance and threatens her safety. Another powerful
  scene portrays her father publicly scolding Trisha, refusing to accept her as
  a woman. These moments reveal the emotional struggle faced by transgender
  individuals, emphasizing the importance of familial acceptance and societal
  awareness.

  Trisha’s relationships with her friends serve as a central theme of the chosen
  family. During the wake, her friends collaborate to ensure she is celebrated
  as her true self. These scenes are both humorous and moving, such as when they
  creatively recreate celebrity looks for each night of her wake. This ritual is
  not merely comic relief; it demonstrates loyalty, love, and affirmation of
  Trisha’s identity even after death, underscoring a broader message about the
  value of support networks in marginalized communities.
