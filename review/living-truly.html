	<p class="p text-justify">Die Beautiful is one of those Filipino films that really hits you when you least expect it. It tells the story of Trisha, a transgender woman who only wants to live happily and be remembered in a beautiful way. Even with the hurtful things people throw at her, she keeps choosing laughter, makeup, and confidence, which is honestly inspiring.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">It's like going through an emotional roller coaster while watching the movie. There are just so many funny scenes that could get you laughing, especially the moments between Trisha and her best friend Barbs. But behind the smiles, the movie also shows the sufferings caused by the rejections and judgments of people.  It reminds us that sometimes the happiest people in front of us are the ones hurting the most inside. Since the movie itself showed many heartwarming messages, some of the most important were about family. Trisha's friends, especially Barbs, are her real support system while her biological family finds it difficult to accept her identity. They are the ones that stands by her side, celebrating with her during happy times and defending her during her painful times.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">This movie teaches us that family is not just about blood, but its about the love, the loyalty, and the understanding. That whoever truly cares for you in life is your real family.</p>

	<p class="p text-justify">It also reminds us to be true to ourselves because pretending will only make us feel more lost. It also shows that we should respect others for who they are. We don’t know the battles they’re hiding behind a smile. And most importantly, that real love doesn’t judge, it accepts you fully.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">Paolo Ballesteros did such an amazing job as Trisha. He made her feel like someone we actually know, someone brave, someone funny, someone human. The film also gives a voice to the LGBTQ+ community in the Philippines, showing the hardships they still face.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">At the end of it all, Die Beautiful stays with you. It makes you think twice about how you treat people. It makes you appreciate those who stay by your side. And honestly, it reminds you that everyone deserves to feel beautiful, loved, and respected for who they are.</p>
