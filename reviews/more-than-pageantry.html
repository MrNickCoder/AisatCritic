  The “Die Beautiful” movie is a strong, sharp and vibrant Filipino film that
  focuses on Trisha Echevarria, a transgender woman whose sudden death during a
  beauty pageant, becomes the frame for revisiting her life through nonlinear
  flashbacks. The structure of the movie is shifting between the spectacle of
  her wake, where friends honor her last wish to appear each night as a
  different celebrity, and scenes of her past. That creates a moving contrast
  between glamour and the painful realities of rejection, violence, and longing
  for acceptance. This storytelling choice allows the film to balance comedy and
  tragedy, making Trisha’s experiences feel both larger-than-life and intimately
  human.

  “Trans Lives, Family, and Chosen Belonging”
</p>
<p class="ff-roboto indent-10 text-justify w-full mb-2">
  The film's best part is its clear and realistic view of LGBTQ+ life in the
  Philippines. It shows how family, religion, and society both hurt and form
  Trisha's identity. Disownment by her father, discrimination in public spaces,
  and the trauma of sexual violence are presented alongside moments of
  chosen-family love, motherhood, and friendship with Barbs, showing that queer
  existence is not only about suffering but also resilience and joy. The movie
  makes viewers face their own biases. It honors the daily courage of trans
  women living true to themselves.

  Paolo Ballesteros delivers a standout performance, combining his real-life
  skill in makeup transformation with subtle, emotionally layered acting that
  communicates Trisha’s hurt and hope even in quiet moments. Christian Bables as
  Barbs adds emotional depth and comic timing, turning the duo into a
  believable, tender partnership that anchors the film’s heart. The film uses
  bright pageant scenes, makeup moments, and colorful designs to show that
  beauty acts as protection and a way to express yourself. Darker shots of
  family fights and hospital rooms reveal the pain that is hidden under the
  shine.

  “Melodrama, Humor, and the Risks of Accessibility”
</p>
<p class="ff-roboto indent-10 text-justify w-full mb-2">
  However, the film sometimes gets too dramatic and has sudden mood changes that
  feels jarring. It includes some corny speeches, like
  <i>“Ikaw ang asawa, Kabit lang ako, P*tangina mo”</i> in a monotone is
  ridiculous funny but also corny. Also, crowd-pleasing parts that make the
  tough issues of the movie seem less harsh. For some viewers, the balance of
  broad comedy and heavy topics such as rape, illness, and death might seem
  uneven, raising questions about whether certain scenes risk undercutting the
  seriousness of the subject matter. Still, these choices also make the film
  accessible to a wide audience, opening space for mainstream discussion of
  trans lives in a commercial Filipino film landscape.

<p class="ff-roboto indent-10 text-justify w-full mb-2">
  That pageant question and Trisha’s answer are one of the emotional cores of
  the film because they summarize her whole journey of self-acceptance as a
  trans woman in a single moment. The question “If you were given the chance to
  live again, what would it be?” is a very typical beauty pageant question, but
  Trisha’s answered:
</p>
<p class="ff-apple-garamond text-center w-full mb-2">
  “If I will die and be blessed to live again, I want to still be who I am in
  this life today… If given a chance to live again, I will choose to be nobody,
  nobody but me.”
</p>
<p class="ff-roboto indent-10 text-justify w-full mb-2">
  Choosing to be herself again, directly challenges the idea that her life is
  something to escape or fix, despite all the violence, rejection, and pain she
  experiences. In a society that constantly tells her that being trans is wrong
  or shameful, her choice to affirm <i>“nobody but me”</i> becomes a small act
  of rebellion, declaring that her identity has value and meaning in this world.

<p class="ff-roboto indent-10 text-justify w-full mb-2">
  The scene also deepens the film’s critique of how pageants and media often use
  LGBTQ+ people as entertainment without fully respecting their humanity. On one
  level, the moment is glamorous and crowd-pleasing, but on another, it exposes
  how hard-won that confidence is, built on years of pain, resilience, and
  support from her chosen family like Barbs. Instead of giving a safe, generic
  answer about success or wealth, Trisha’s response turns the question into a
  political statement: that trans lives are worth living again, not in a
  “different body” or “normal life,” but exactly as they are.

  “A Tender, Defiant Portrait of Queer Existence”
</p>
<p class="ff-roboto indent-10 text-justify w-full mb-2">
  Overall, Die Beautiful ultimately stands out not just as a touching story of
  one trans woman, but as a landmark in Filipino queer cinema that proves
  mainstream films can center LGBTQ+ lives with depth, empathy, and complexity.
  By following Trisha from childhood dreams to pageant stages to her carefully
  staged wake, the film insists that her life—messy, joyful, and painful—is
  worthy of the same narrative care usually reserved for straight, cisgender
  protagonists, and this alone is a powerful intervention in a local industry
  that often limits queer characters to comic relief. Its mix of humor,
  heartbreak, and visual flair results in a memorable tribute to a “true queen”
  whose life story critiques prejudice while insisting that queer people deserve
  not only to live—but to live, and die, beautifully.
