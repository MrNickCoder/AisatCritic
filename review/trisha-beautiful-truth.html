	<p class="p text-justify">The movie “Die Beautiful” really left a strong impression on me because of how it balanced humor and heartbreak. Even though the story deals with a lot of painful and emotional moments, the movie still manages to make the audience laugh in a way that feels natural and genuine. Paolo Ballesteros and the rest of the cast were amazing in their roles. Their acting felt real, and the way they delivered their lines made me and my group mates laugh one moment and then suddenly feel emotional the next. That mix of feelings is something I really appreciated because it made the movie more memorable and relatable.</p>

	<p class="p text-justify">What stood out to me most is the life story of Trisha. She went through so many challenges just because she was being true to her identity. The film didn’t try to sugarcoat her struggles it showed the reality of how society often treats people like her. Despite the discrimination, judgment, and lack of acceptance from her own family, Trisha continued to be herself.</p>

	<p class="p text-justify">She didn’t pretend or hide just to make other people comfortable. For me, that was very inspiring because it shows a kind of bravery that many people today still struggle to show.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">Watching her journey made me think about how many individuals still face the same treatment she did. A lot of people still deal with hate just because of their gender identity. But what I really admire about Trisha is that she chose to live her life openly and proudly, even when it was difficult. That kind of courage is something I think everyone can learn from. Her story made me realize that being true to yourself is not always easy, but it’s something worth fighting for.</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">Another thing I appreciated in the movie is the importance of friendships. Trisha’s friends were the ones who truly understood her and supported her no matter what. Even when her family turned their back on her, her friends stayed by her side. They were the ones who loved her for who she was, and they continued to honor her even after she passed away. It showed me that sometimes, the people who are not related to you by blood can become your real family. That part of the story made the film even more touching.</p>

	<p class="p text-justify">For me, “Die Beautiful” is more than just a movie it teaches a strong lesson about acceptance, courage, and self-love. It reminded me that everyone deserves respect and the freedom to express who they are without fear. Trisha’s life may have been difficult, but she showed that you can still live beautifully by being authentic and proud of yourself. Her story continues to inspire people, including me, to embrace who we are and to respect others for who they choose to be.</p>
