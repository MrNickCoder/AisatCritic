	<p class="p text-justify">The “Die Beautiful” movie is a strong, sharp and vibrant Filipino film that focuses on Trisha Echevarria, a transgender woman whose sudden death during a beauty pageant, becomes the frame for revisiting her life through nonlinear flashbacks. The structure of the movie is shifting between the spectacle of her wake, where friends honor her last wish to appear each night as a different celebrity, and scenes of her past. That creates a moving contrast between glamour and the painful realities of rejection, violence, and longing for acceptance. This storytelling choice allows the film to balance comedy and tragedy, making Trisha’s experiences feel both larger-than-life and intimately human.</p>

	<p class="h4">“Trans Lives, Family, and Chosen Belonging”</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">The film's best part is its clear and realistic view of LGBTQ+ life in the Philippines. It shows how family, religion, and society both hurt and form Trisha's identity. Disownment by her father, discrimination in public spaces, and the trauma of sexual violence are presented alongside moments of chosen-family love, motherhood, and friendship with Barbs, showing that queer existence is not only about suffering but also resilience and joy. The movie makes viewers face their own biases. It honors the daily courage of trans women living true to themselves.</p>

	<p class="p text-justify">Paolo Ballesteros delivers a standout performance, combining his real-life skill in makeup transformation with subtle, emotionally layered acting that communicates Trisha’s hurt and hope even in quiet moments. Christian Bables as Barbs adds emotional depth and comic timing, turning the duo into a believable, tender partnership that anchors the film’s heart. The film uses bright pageant scenes, makeup moments, and colorful designs to show that beauty acts as protection and a way to express yourself. Darker shots of family fights and hospital rooms reveal the pain that is hidden under the shine.</p>
	<p class="h4">“Melodrama, Humor, and the Risks of Accessibility”</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">However, the film sometimes gets too dramatic and has sudden mood changes that feels jarring. It includes some corny speeches, like <i>“Ikaw ang asawa, Kabit lang ako, P*tangina mo”</i> in a monotone is ridiculous funny but also corny. Also, crowd-pleasing parts that make the tough issues of the movie seem less harsh. For some viewers, the balance of broad comedy and heavy topics such as rape, illness, and death might seem uneven, raising questions about whether certain scenes risk undercutting the seriousness of the subject matter. Still, these choices also make the film accessible to a wide audience, opening space for mainstream discussion of trans lives in a commercial Filipino film landscape.</p>

	<p class="p text-justify">That pageant question and Trisha’s answer are one of the emotional cores of the film because they summarize her whole journey of self-acceptance as a trans woman in a single moment. The question “If you were given the chance to live again, what would it be?” is a very typical beauty pageant question, but Trisha’s answered:</p>
	<p class="l text-center">“If I will die and be blessed to live again, I want to still be who I am in this life today… If given a chance to live again, I will choose to be nobody, nobody but me.”</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">Choosing to be herself again, directly challenges the idea that her life is something to escape or fix, despite all the violence, rejection, and pain she experiences. In a society that constantly tells her that being trans is wrong or shameful, her choice to affirm <i>“nobody but me”</i> becomes a small act of rebellion, declaring that her identity has value and meaning in this world.</p>

	</div>
	<p class="p text-justify">The scene also deepens the film’s critique of how pageants and media often use LGBTQ+ people as entertainment without fully respecting their humanity. On one level, the moment is glamorous and crowd-pleasing, but on another, it exposes how hard-won that confidence is, built on years of pain, resilience, and support from her chosen family like Barbs. Instead of giving a safe, generic answer about success or wealth, Trisha’s response turns the question into a political statement: that trans lives are worth living again, not in a “different body” or “normal life,” but exactly as they are.</p>
	<p class="h4">“A Tender, Defiant Portrait of Queer Existence”</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">Overall, Die Beautiful ultimately stands out not just as a touching story of one trans woman, but as a landmark in Filipino queer cinema that proves mainstream films can center LGBTQ+ lives with depth, empathy, and complexity. By following Trisha from childhood dreams to pageant stages to her carefully staged wake, the film insists that her life—messy, joyful, and painful—is worthy of the same narrative care usually reserved for straight, cisgender protagonists, and this alone is a powerful intervention in a local industry that often limits queer characters to comic relief. Its mix of humor, heartbreak, and visual flair results in a memorable tribute to a “true queen” whose life story critiques prejudice while insisting that queer people deserve not only to live—but to live, and die, beautifully.</p>
