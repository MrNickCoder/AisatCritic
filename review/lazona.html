	<p class="h1">Trisha’s Beautiful Truth: A review of Die Beautiful</p>
	<p class="p text-justify">Die Beautiful tells the story of Trisha (Paolo Ballesteros), in various points in her life, as her closest friend Barbs (Christian Bables) tries to give her a funeral fit for the beautiful life that she’s lived. Skillfully combines themes of identity, acceptance, and resiliency against the backdrop of Philippine culture. A very touching scene that shows the movie’s main ideas happens when Trisha, even though her family doesn’t accept her due to her sexuality, joins a local beauty contest. This scene clearly shows how strong and determined Trisha is to be herself, even when society doesn’t approve. Trisha unexpectedly passes away, and her last wish is to be dressed as a different famous celebrity each day during her wake.</p>

	<p class="p text-justify">As her friends mourn and reminisce about her sudden passing after winning Binibining Gay Pilipinas, Trisha’s life story plays out through a non-linear narrative. In these fragmented slices of life, we witness Trisha’s journey from her traumatic childhood and high school life, to her tragedy and triumphs as a struggling beauty queen. Prudente, J.

	<p class="p text-justify">The movie takes place in the Philippines, and where it’s set is super important. The country’s strong beliefs about what’s “normal,” especially when it comes to gender and who you’re attracted to, are the backdrop for Trisha’s story. The movie doesn’t hide the unfair treatment and prejudice that transgender people face. But it also shows the happiness, strength, and support within the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

	<p class="p text-justify">One of the best things about “Die Beautiful” is how it uses humor to talk about serious stuff. Trisha’s wake is wild and over-the-top, with her dressed as a different famous woman each day. It’s a spectacle, but it also makes a statement. It challenges the usual sad and serious ways we deal with death, turning it into a party that celebrates life and being yourself. But the movie also digs into Trisha’s personal life, her relationships, and what she dreams of. It shows her struggling to be accepted by her family, looking for love, and wanting to live an honest life. The movie does a good job of making Trisha feel like a real person. You can relate to her and feel for her, even if you don’t totally understand what she’s going through.</p>

	<p class="p text-justify">One of the most powerful conversation in the movie is between Trisha and her best friend, Barbs, played by Christian Bables. Trisha tells Barbs how scared she is that her father will never truly accept her. She says something like:</p>
	<p class="p text-center"><i>“I’ve spent my whole life trying to make him proud. But no matter what I do, it’s never enough for him.”</i></p>
	<p class="p text-justify">This line really is impactful for every member of LGBTQ+ because everyone wants their parents to accept them. It’s especially painful for LGBTQ+ people who often have to deal with their families not understanding or supporting them. It shows how hard it can be to live in a world where people question or invalidate who you are.This moment is very important to understand what the movie is saying: that beauty is not just about looks, but about inner strength, the ability to bounce back, and the courage to be yourself in a world that often wants you to be like everyone else. It celebrates Philippine culture, friendship, and the strong spirit of those who dare to live honestly, making it a key part of the movie’s message. The movie doesn’t hide the cruel reality of the society, the whole movie is the reality that we face in our country. </p>
